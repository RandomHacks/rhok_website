-- SUMMARY --

"Multi path autocomplete" helps anyone who creates menu items on
admin/build/menu/*/add to enter the path to nodes.
It changes the input field for the menu path to an autocomplete text field so
you can simply enter the title of the node and will get a list with all
matching values. If you select one of them its path will be placed into the
textfield.

If path.module is enabled autocomplete is working for URL aliases, too.
